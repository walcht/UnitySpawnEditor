## About
A simple custom editor inspector script for editing spawn\waypoint positions.
Spawn positions are stored in a C#```List<Vector3>``` container in an instance of a ScriptableObject called ```SpawnDatabase```.

When an instance of the ScriptableObject ```SpawnDatabase``` is selected in the Project window, __selected__ spawns from the list in the custom inspector are shown in the scene view.
For istance spawns 1, 4, 6 and 9 are selected and they are shown in the scene view:

## Installation
To keep things simple, all you need to do is: 
1. copy ```SpawnDatabase.cs``` and ```SpawnCustomInspector.cs``` into your ```Scripts``` folder.

## Usage
1. Create a ```SpawnDatabase``` instance throught the assets menu ```Create/SO/Spawn Database```
2. Select the previously created instance of ```SpawnDatabase``` ScriptableObject
3. Spawn positions appear in the scene view as movable objects. You can now use the scene view with the custom inspector to properly place your spawn positions

## TODO
* Add new spawn positions using the scene view
